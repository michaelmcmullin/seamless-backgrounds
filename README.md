# Seamless Backgrounds
Draw patterns that will repeat nicely!

Here's a [live demo](https://michaelmcmullin.github.io/seamless-backgrounds/).

Click on a color, then use the mouse to draw patterns in the small box to the
right. The larger area will update to show a tiled version of your masterpiece!
